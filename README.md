MomenTASK - Laravel API Project

📌 Project Overview

This is a Laravel-based API project that includes authentication, user management, Google Maps integration, and logging functionalities. The project is designed to provide a robust backend solution for handling user authentication, notifications, and tracking locations.

🚀 Features Implemented

🔐 Authentication (JWT)

Implemented JWT authentication to secure API endpoints.

Users can register and log in using their mobile number and password.

📩 OTP Verification (Twilio)

Implemented OTP verification for user registration using Twilio.

Note: Twilio's OTP service is a paid feature, so I couldn't activate it, but the full implementation is done and ready to use once a Twilio account is set up.

📍 Google Maps Integration

Integrated Google Maps API to fetch and calculate distances between users and delivery representatives.

Note: Google Maps API requires a paid subscription, so I couldn't fully test it, but the implementation is in place and should work when an API key is added.

📊 Database Seeding & Factories

Created Seeders and Factories to generate random user data for testing.

This ensures that the database has realistic test data for API development.

🛠 Laravel Telescope (Debugging & Monitoring)

Integrated Laravel Telescope for in-depth logging and debugging.

Telescope is fully configured and operational, providing detailed logs of API requests, queries, and errors.

🔥 Firebase Push Notifications

Exception: I attempted to integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.

Since this was my first time working with Firebase, I faced some challenges and couldn't complete the implementation.

However, it is easy to learn, and I plan to revisit it soon.

🛢 Database & Migrations

Structured and optimized database schemas with proper relationships.

Ensured smooth migrations and data integrity across tables.

⚠️ Project Limitations

The project is not fully optimized due to time constraints and personal circumstances.

Some tasks, such as Firebase integration, were not fully completed but can be easily added in future iterations.

The Google Maps API and Twilio OTP services require paid subscriptions, so they were not tested in a live environment.

🎯 Future Improvements

Complete Firebase push notifications.

Optimize API performance and implement caching.

Enhance security measures with rate limiting and advanced authentication policies.

Improve documentation with detailed API endpoints and Postman collection.

💡 Overall, the project is functional and well-structured, with most core features implemented successfully. 🚀🔥
